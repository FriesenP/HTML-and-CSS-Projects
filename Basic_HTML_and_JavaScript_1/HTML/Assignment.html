		<h1>The balance of maintaining dead trees for habitat, yet creating safe enviromnents for people</h1>
		<p>Trees are an important part of our urban enviroment, they provide shade, fresh air to breath, and countless habitats for many birds and insects.</p>
		<p>Even when a tree dies and is able to be left standing as a habitat stump it provides a unique enviroment that can only be found in these standing 
		trunks. And for some birds they require that type of habitat to nest in. The down side is as the tree decays it becomes unstable and poses a falling risk.</p> 
		<p>With the rate of development and incresae in population in parks and green spaces, the need to create safe enviroments for people visiting these
		green spaces means that these types of habitats are becoming less and less.</p>
