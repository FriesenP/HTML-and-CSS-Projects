		grew up in the mountains in a place called the High Grounds. It was here he learned at the young age of 
		14 to operate a chain saw. He started working for neighbours after school and on weekends cutting firewood
		to make money. One day the client he was working for hired a tree climber to limb up a few trees in the garden 
		to allow for some more light. It was that day and moment Feter knew what he wanted to do!
