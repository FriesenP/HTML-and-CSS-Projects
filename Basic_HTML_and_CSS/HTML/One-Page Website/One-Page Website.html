						Friesen Tree Care is a small company based in beautiful British Columbia! We specialize in large tree removals
						in tight locations. If we cant take down trees conventionaly with ropes and pulleys then we use cranes to assist.
						Cranes are becoming more of a part of our operations with the increase of housing and development. 
					</font></p>
					<p><font size="5">
						With the increase of development and housing comes the removal of trees to create room for these bulidings to be
						built. Typically municipalities have bylaws in place to protect trees and retain as many as possible. During the 
						process of development the tree's that are being retainied get fencing put up around the root zones to create what
						is called a "tree protection zone".
					</font></p>
					<p><font size="5">
						Unfortunatly most trees dont show signs of root zone impact or nearby comstruction for at least a year, so what
						happens often is once these buliding are done being built a year or two down the road these trees will sometimes 
						die, and thats where we come in.
