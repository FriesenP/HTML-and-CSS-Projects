		<h1>The balance of maintaining dead trees for habitat, yet creating safe enviromnents for people</h1>
		Trees are an important part of our urban enviroment, they provide shade, fresh air to breath, and countless habitats for many birds and insects.
		Even when trees dies and are left standing as habitat stumps they provide a unique enviroment for some birds that require that type of hahbitat to nest in. 
		And with the rate of development and the need to create safe surrounding for people these types of habitats are becoming more and more scarce.
